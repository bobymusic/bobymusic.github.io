<h1>Let's listen to Boby Selamet Hartono's music!</h1>

<h2>The rules</h2>
<p>Wait!? What!? Why do I need to READ rules just after entering this website? Well, the answer is because it's good for you! I want to be a better person by giving good things to people and you are one of those people! It's good for you to read RULES because I want you to become accustomed to reading especially rules and manuals. I believe this habit of reading (especially rules and manuals) will give you happiness.</p>
<p>So, what are the rules? The rules are simple. These are the rules:
<ol>
        <li>all the music in this website are mine and they're copyrighted with me (Boby Selamet Hartono) as the author;</li>
        <li>feel free to listen to my music;</li>
        <li>feel homey here;</li>
        <li>consider to become a person of cheerfulness, curiosity, and focus and abandon cowardice.</li>
</ol></p>

<h2>What is this website?</h2>
<p>The title and the header of this website is pretty self-explanatory. You could listen to my music here. Whether you want to listen or not is up to you.</p>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am Boby Selamet Hartono. A person who is living and working in Jakarta Pusat, a city in Indonesia.</p>

<h2>Let's listen to my music!</h2>
